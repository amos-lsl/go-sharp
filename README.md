# go-sharp

GO-Sharp is a multiple process solution for HTTP-FLV of [SRS](https://github.com/ossrs/srs).

Recommend to use:

1. [GO-Oryx](https://github.com/ossrs/go-oryx), support multiple processes, SRS++.
1. [SO_REUSEPORT](https://github.com/ossrs/srs/issues/775), directly start multiple SRS to listen at the same port.
